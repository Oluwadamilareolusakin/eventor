# Description
An event planning and management app that allows you create an event, manage your invite list and get invited to events by other users.

I rolled out custom a authentication and authorization system for it.

[See a live demo](http://eventor-io.herokuapp.com)

# How authentication works
* When you sign up, you get an email that gives you permission to login.
* On subsequent logins, you will also be sent a magic mail to login.
** No passwords of any form are required

## Built With
- Ruby on Rails
- Javascript(ES6)

#### and deployed to Heroku
