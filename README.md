# Description
An event planning and management app that allows you create an event, manage your invite list and get invited to events by other users.

I rolled out custom a authentication and authorization system for it.

# How authentication works
* When you sign up, you get an email that gives you permission to login.
* On subsequent logins, you will also be sent a magic mail to login.
** No passwords of any form are required

# Use
* Feel free to clone or fork the project. 
* Be sure to run `bundle` in the project directory after cloning it to your local machine.
* Also ensure you are running the same version of rails (6.0.0+) to ensure behaviours are as expected
* Run `rails s` in your terminal while in the project directory to startup your local server
* Visit `localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application
* Enjoy!
